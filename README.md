# 🎛️ **LangGraph Calculator Agent**

This project is an implementation of an agent that utilizes LangGraph and OpenAI to generate two random numbers and calculate their sum. The agent is designed to perform basic operations using nodes that interact with a language model.

## 📋 **Project Description**

The application consists of an **agent** that follows a simple workflow:

1. **Node 1:** Generates a random number from 1 to 10 using OpenAI's language model.
2. **Node 2:** Generates a second random number from 1 to 10 using the same model.
3. **Final Node:** Adds the two generated numbers and returns the result.
